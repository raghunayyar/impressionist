        <h3>What is Impress?</h3>
        Impress is an ownCloud application that can play presentation based on the amazing <a href="http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js" class="github-profiles">impress.js</a> library.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
        You have to define your presentation by writing a HTML file manually. But there are great examples and it isnÂ´t that difficult.
        Just put a HTML file with the file extension .impress into your ownCloud and it will show up here in the Impress app automatically.
        If you click on it it opens up in a new windows.
